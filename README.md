# RoboAide

## Abstract
The ability to walk or reach an object on the top shelf is a privilege that people take for granted every single day. When someone is no longer capable of performing simple tasks
around the house, a home health aide is the usual solution to assist with everyday life. Mobility has been shown to be the most common disability among the elderly with millions of citizens in the U.S. alone requiring help with household tasks. Although they are considered necessary, these professions that support immobilized patients have expensive rates. This paper introduces the prototype for an autonomous robotic arm that is able to accept a command to retrieve an object through voice input, use machine vision in conjunction with an attached camera to navigate its environment, locate and fetch the object, and return it to the user. Influenced by previous projects and research, the manipulator presented in this document could also be applied beyond the field of independent living; however, with the rise in aging population of baby-boomers and the deficiency of nurses in the workforce create a need for jobs such as proffering tools in the operating room to be filled. The target of this Robo-Aide is to provide a cost-efficient, un-intrusive, and consistent solution to improving the quality of life at home for people with mobility impairments or medical instrument identification and retrieval.
